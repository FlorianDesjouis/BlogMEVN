To run the project you must go in Client side by doing 'cd /ClientSide'.
then, you must do 'npm install'.
After it, you'll have to make a 'npm run dev'.
it will make the project run at localhost:8080.
you just have to go to your browser and type 'localhost:8080' in the url.

You'll have to run the ServerSide too.
To do so, you'll have to go back to the root.
then you'll do 'cd /ServerSide.
You'll do another 'npm install'.
After this, you just have to run 'node index.js' or 'nodemon index.js' if you have nodemon. If you don't, you can install it globally with 'npm install -g nodemon'.

Project made by Alexis Bonnet and Florian Desjouis.
